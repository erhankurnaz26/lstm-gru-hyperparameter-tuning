A Comparative Analysis of Traditional and Custom Hyperparameter Tuning Techniques for LSTM and GRU Models in Time Series Forecasting

This project explores the impact of hyperparameter tuning on deep learning models for time series forecasting.  
It compares **traditional methods** (Grid Search, Random Search) with **custom optimization techniques** (Bayesian Optimization via KerasTuner and Optunaâ€™s TPE with pruning).  
The results show that advanced, adaptive tuning strategies significantly improve both model accuracy and training efficiency compared to traditional exhaustive searches.
